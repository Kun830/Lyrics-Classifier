Just wait another a month I’ll buy Chanel（只要再等一个月我就可以给她买Chanel)For her, or make her laugh just like Chappelle(或者逗她笑就像Dave Chappelle)See I’ll try to do both and never let go and make her feel my love just like Adele(我会两个都努力做到，让她感觉到我的爱 就像Adele的歌）but I think I was on a different, side（但我觉得我曾经在一个完全不样的境地）Before she took me I lived in a different, life（在她接受我以前我过着完全不一样的生活）I’ve got too high even to lie more than two nights and I know I shouldn’t even, hide（我有high到连谎都撒不出，不止连续两晚上都这样，我知道我不应该隐瞒这些）Like I’ve been in a relationship and everything but I never had love for my ex ex hoe（我当然也有谈过恋爱 但我对之前的女人并没有真的感觉）We communicate and meditate and such but I couldn’t even let em listen to the XX tho（我们会交流也会思考，但我不要和她们听The XX的歌）I don’t really miss her i don’t really call her but I just think about are we gonna have *** tho（我平时也不想她，不给她打电话，主要就是想着要不要OOXX）I guess in my mind she wasn’t my kind so I already been looking for the next next girl（所以我觉得在我脑子里面她本来就不是我要的，我也已经在想以后的女人）所以这些是我一部分的过去也解释了我之前一部分的逻辑这花掉了我之前一部分的货币所以我也没想过哪天需要脱离直到有一个人让我落地用她的魔力和最美丽的所以 让没有人能再破例我只想给她拖地再也不想听到她的啜泣展开
